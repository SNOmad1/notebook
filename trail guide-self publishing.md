# self-publishing
*Trail guide to self publish books.*

After trailing it (as an housing architect), I'm mapping the best path I know to self publish a book.<br>
It might be useful to others doing this lonely journey.

## Choosing tools

Markdown, Latex, MS Word, Indesign or Scrivener?
- Markdown if you want to publish digitally.
- Latex if you want to print it with maximum quality.
- MS Word if you want to keep it simple (and unproductive).
- Scrivener if you are writing a novel.
- Indesign (or Scribus) if the design of your publication is crucial.

## My productivity system

- I write Markdown on a text editor. Then convert it to Word via [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/):

		pandoc myFile.md -f markdown_github -t docx -o myFile.docx

- And finally I adjust style and publish it as PDF on MS Word.

Why?
- A text editor is an 'order of magnitude' more productive than a word processor.
- I can still print it with reasonable quality without learning Latex or Indesign.

## Choosing a self publisher

[Amazon](https://kdp.amazon.com/) to self publish paperbacks is the obvious choice.
