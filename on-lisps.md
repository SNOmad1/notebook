# Notes on Lisps (Clojure, Clojurescript, Racket)

## Clojurescript tooling

I've tried most avaliable solutions but I didn't choose yet:

- VScode + Calva: I couldn't understand the fuss around it. I didn't even manage to connect a REPL..

- Atom + Chlorine: Simple solution. A text editor and a REPL. I used Lumo. Not without quirks of course.

- Emacs + Cider: Emacs is an old beast that after my fifth or sixth trial along the years I really believe that worths to tame. It certainly would become loyal for life. For now, I did't get even as far as installling Cider..

- IntelliJ + Cursive: Simple solution but it feels heavy for a drifter.

- Sublime + SublimeRepl: Basic support.
