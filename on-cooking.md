# Notes on amateur cooking

## Beginner level

### Pasta

- Pasta is one of easiest plates you can cook. Small mistakes will not make a big change on results.

## Advanced level

### Baking

- Mistakes are less forgiving in baking.

#### Home oven pizza recipe

- 250ml (yes ml) of flour. Prefer type 65 and specially without self raising - You'll use live ferment. 
- 100ml of tepid water. Prefer tepid water (~ 35 C) for a good environment for live ferment.
- full coffee spoon of salt.  
- 5 grams of live ferment.

How to make it: Mix the tepid water with the ferment and salt in a bowl. only then pour the flour using a sieve (you don't want to crete a cement). Mix. Reserve it a hot place and wait 4 hours or more.

How to bake it: Home oven with maximum temperature. Bake it near the oven bottom until half cooked. Take it out and put toppings. Finish baking it in middle of the oven.

Results: Not restaurant quality but better that frozen pizza by far.
